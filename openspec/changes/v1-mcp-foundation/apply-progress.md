Task count: 25/42 complete.

## Strict TDD Cycle Evidence
| Task / microcycle | Test file / layer | Safety Net | RED | GREEN | TRIANGULATE | REFACTOR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.11–2.13c | SQLite transaction/integrity package tests | Prior GHA baselines recorded in earlier apply-progress revisions; WDAC blocks local test execution. | Independent transaction/integrity RED runs recorded through CI 32419671217. | GHA package/full-suite and vet green through CI 32419671217. | Distinct retry, cancellation, mapping, ordering, corruption, size, and bounded-query paths. | Completed in task 2.13/2.13c only. |
| 2.14 private acquisition | `internal/source/acquire_test.go`, GHA Ubuntu source fakes | CI 32419671217 green before acquisition work; local Go test execution blocked by WDAC. | CI 32421871674, 32422071150, 32423035573, 32423204499, and 32423417915 independently failed the missing home, directory, reservation, escape, and admission behaviors. | CI 32423941299 passed `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...`. | Home, directory, exclusive-file/Lstat, traversal/symlink, admission ordering, and immutable-source cases exercise distinct paths. | Not assigned; task 2.16 remains pending. |
| 2.15 confirmed cleanup deletion | `internal/source/acquire_test.go`, `internal/ownership/sqlite/ledger_test.go`, GHA temporary SQLite/source fakes | CI 32423941299 was green before task 2.15; WDAC blocked local test execution. | CI 32424557263 failed only `TestAcquirerDeletesExactOwnershipOnlyAfterConfirmedPrivateCleanup`: `cleanup/delete/events = 1/0/[admit reserve copy stat download remove stat]`. | CI 32424770121 passed `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...`. | Success proves exact record deletion after `Remove`/not-found `Stat`; remove failure, stat error, and still-present path each retain the row; SQLite proves exact-record transactional deletion/mismatch rejection. | Not assigned; task 2.16 remains pending. |
| 2.16 acquisition fixture refactor | `internal/source/acquire_test.go`, package-local approval tests | GHA CI 32425042252 passed before the refactor; WDAC blocked local test execution. | Existing 2.14/2.15 approval tests were retained unchanged; no behavior change was specified or introduced. | GHA CI 32425625908 passed `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...` on the refactor commit. | Existing independent acquisition, ordering, cleanup, and uncertain-cleanup cases retain distinct request/cleanup fixture state. | Replaced repeated default request/cleanup/ledger construction with one explicit fixture constructor; CI remained green. |

## Work Unit Evidence: 3B.2 task 2.14
| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Focused test command | GHA CI 32423941299: `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...` exited 0. |
| Runtime harness | GHA Ubuntu source fakes exercised private acquisition behaviors. No live IBM i boundary exists; WDAC blocked local test binaries and was not bypassed. |
| Rollback boundary | Revert commits `6ba0d1f` through `7790eed` to remove only private acquisition/reservation tests and boundaries. |

## Work Unit Evidence: 3B.2 task 2.15
| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Focused test command | GHA CI 32424770121: `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...` exited 0 after the task 2.15 GREEN. |
| Runtime harness | GHA Ubuntu ran the source fake and temporary SQLite harness: exact private path cleanup performs `Remove`, then `Stat`-not-found, then a transactional exact-record delete. No live IBM i boundary exists. |
| Static / builds | Local `gofmt`, `go vet ./...`, compile-only `go test -c` for `./internal/source` (output removed), six `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds for windows/darwin/linux × amd64/arm64, and `git diff --check` exited 0. No local Go test binary ran. |
| Rollback boundary | Revert `fb60a3a` and `1d40c5a` to remove only confirmed cleanup deletion tests, the ownership `Delete` contract/SQLite transaction, and acquisition cleanup wiring; reservation, copy, and recovery remain untouched. |

## Work Unit Evidence: 3B.2 task 2.16
| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Focused test command | GHA CI 32425625908: `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...` exited 0 on `5a17a1ae89a08b4cbc3c6eeda611663b3973746b`. |
| Runtime harness | GHA Ubuntu executed the in-process source fake and temporary SQLite cleanup path. No live IBM i runtime boundary exists for this fixture-only refactor; WDAC blocked local test binaries and was not bypassed. |
| Static / builds | Local `gofmt -d internal/source/acquire_test.go`, `go vet ./...`, compile-only `go test -c` for `./internal/source` (output removed), six `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./...` targets for windows/darwin/linux × amd64/arm64, and `git diff --check` exited 0. No local Go test binary ran. |
| Rollback boundary | Revert `5a17a1a` to restore only repeated acquisition test fixture construction in `internal/source/acquire_test.go`; 2.14/2.15 production behavior, independent tests, cleanup lifecycle, and all recovery scope remain unchanged. |

## Delivery / exclusions
- Draft PR #38 remains stacked-to-main → `main`, open and draft; issue #37 remains approved.
- Maintainer-selected review ceiling: 800 authored additions + deletions. Current PR count is 468 additions + 85 deletions = 553, under the ceiling; it remains a ceiling, not permission for unrelated scope. Delivery remains `ask-on-risk` resolved as `stacked-to-main`.
- Excluded: recovery-loop behavior, acquisition/rescope/reset/settle, and merge.

## Settlement Handoff
- Authorized attempt token: `sha256:ee1a01278ac83760fd1d30b34e8c044ac597b27bd1f220b4b51cb5fe9f242858`.
