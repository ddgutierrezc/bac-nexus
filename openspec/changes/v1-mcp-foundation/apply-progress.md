# Apply Progress: v1 MCP Foundation

## Cumulative Task State
- [x] 1.1–1.6 — source foundation.
- [x] 2.1–2.4 — remote snapshot safety and SQLite dependency gate.
- [x] 2.5–2.7 — SQLite ledger foundation.
- [x] 2.8–2.10 — filesystem policy.
- [x] 2.11–2.13 — transaction retry/readback and refactor.
- [x] 2.13a–2.13c — integrity verifier microcycles and evidence refactor.
- [x] 2.14 — private acquisition boundaries.
- [x] 2.15 — exact private cleanup and transactional ownership deletion.
- [ ] 2.16 and later — acquisition refactor, recovery, and remaining product scope.

Task count: 24/42 complete.

## Strict TDD Cycle Evidence
| Task / microcycle | Test file / layer | Safety Net | RED | GREEN | TRIANGULATE | REFACTOR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.11–2.13c | SQLite transaction/integrity package tests | Prior GHA baselines recorded in earlier apply-progress revisions; WDAC blocks local test execution. | Independent transaction/integrity RED runs recorded through CI 32419671217. | GHA package/full-suite and vet green through CI 32419671217. | Distinct retry, cancellation, mapping, ordering, corruption, size, and bounded-query paths. | Completed in task 2.13/2.13c only. |
| 2.14 private acquisition | `internal/source/acquire_test.go`, GHA Ubuntu source fakes | CI 32419671217 green before acquisition work; local Go test execution blocked by WDAC. | CI 32421871674, 32422071150, 32423035573, 32423204499, and 32423417915 independently failed the missing home, directory, reservation, escape, and admission behaviors. | CI 32423941299 passed `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...`. | Home, directory, exclusive-file/Lstat, traversal/symlink, admission ordering, and immutable-source cases exercise distinct paths. | Not assigned; task 2.16 remains pending. |
| 2.15 confirmed cleanup deletion | `internal/source/acquire_test.go`, `internal/ownership/sqlite/ledger_test.go`, GHA temporary SQLite/source fakes | CI 32423941299 was green before task 2.15; WDAC blocked local test execution. | CI 32424557263 failed only `TestAcquirerDeletesExactOwnershipOnlyAfterConfirmedPrivateCleanup`: `cleanup/delete/events = 1/0/[admit reserve copy stat download remove stat]`. | CI 32424770121 passed `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...`. | Success proves exact record deletion after `Remove`/not-found `Stat`; remove failure, stat error, and still-present path each retain the row; SQLite proves exact-record transactional deletion/mismatch rejection. | Not assigned; task 2.16 remains pending. |

## Work Unit Evidence: 3B.2 task 2.14
| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Focused test command | GHA CI 32423941299: `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...` exited 0. |
| Runtime harness | GHA Ubuntu source fakes exercised private acquisition behaviors. No live IBM i boundary exists; WDAC blocked local test binaries and was not bypassed. |
| Rollback boundary | Revert commits `6ba0d1f` through `7790eed` to remove only private acquisition/reservation tests and boundaries. |

## Work Unit Evidence: 3B.2 task 2.15
| Evidence | Result |
|---|---|
| Focused test command | GHA CI 32424770121: `go test -count=1 ./...` and `go vet ./...` exited 0 after the task 2.15 GREEN. |
| Runtime harness | GHA Ubuntu ran the source fake and temporary SQLite harness: exact private path cleanup performs `Remove`, then `Stat`-not-found, then a transactional exact-record delete. No live IBM i boundary exists. |
| Static / builds | Local `gofmt`, `go vet ./...`, compile-only `go test -c` for `./internal/source` (output removed), six `CGO_ENABLED=0` builds for windows/darwin/linux × amd64/arm64, and `git diff --check` exited 0. No local Go test binary ran. |
| Rollback boundary | Revert `fb60a3a` and `1d40c5a` to remove only confirmed cleanup deletion tests, the ownership `Delete` contract/SQLite transaction, and acquisition cleanup wiring; reservation, copy, and recovery remain untouched. |

## Delivery / exclusions
- Draft PR #38 remains stacked-to-main → `main`, open and draft; issue #37 remains approved.
- Maintainer-selected review ceiling: 800 authored additions + deletions. It is a ceiling, not permission for unrelated scope; delivery strategy remains `ask-on-risk` resolved as `stacked-to-main`.
- Excluded: task 2.16 refactor, recovery-loop behavior, acquisition/rescope/reset/settle, and merge.

## Settlement Handoff

- Proposed BOM-less UTF-8 canonical JSON evidence revision: `sha256:fe3d4e894392dfc5fbcf7a868b9e9db629aa2b27fca2c2662469c15653ff0185` for `{attempt_token,change,ci_run:32424770121,final_head:"1d40c5a7566442aa7cf930f2fbdb9c6643504dfe",pr:38,task:"2.15",work_unit:"3B.2"}`.
- The parent/orchestrator retains acquire, rescope, reset, settle, recovery, and merge authority.
